    <h2>Programming Basics</h2>

    <p>
        Variables have to be declared before they can be used. From ES6 onwards, JavaScript uses the keywords const and
        let to declare variables. The keyword const is used when the variable will not be reassigned to another value,
        whereas let is used if the variable might be reassigned later in the program.
