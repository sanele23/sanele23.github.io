        <p>
            Variables have to be declared before they can be used. From ES6 onwards, JavaScript uses the keywords const
            and
            let to declare variables. The keyword const is used when the variable will not be reassigned to another
            value,
            whereas let is used if the variable might be reassigned later in the program.

        <h2>Arrays, Logic and Loops</h2>
        <p>
            In JavaScript we have data structures such as arrays, sets, and maps. This chapter also included topics
            based on
            the different types of logical statements in JavaScript that allow the control flow of the program.

        <h3>Arrays</h3>
        <p>
            An array is an ordered list of values. Here's an example of how to create an array on JavaScript: <br>
        </p>
        <span class="code-example">const myArray = ['eggs', 'milk', 'butter'];
        </span>
        <br>
        <div class="extra-info">
            <!-- adding -->
            <h4>Adding Values to Arrays</h4>
            <span class="code-example">myArray.push('juice');
            </span>

            <!-- removing -->
            <h4>Removing Values from Arrays</h4>
            <span class="code-example">delete myArray[3];
            </span>


            <!-- Destructuring Arrays -->
            <h4>Destructuring Arrays</h4>
            <p>
                Destructuring an array is the concept of taking values out of an array and presenting them as individual
                values.
            </p>
            <span class="code-example">const [x,y] = [1,2];
            </span>

            <!-- adding -->
            <h4>Merging Arrays</h4>
            <p>
                The <em>concat()</em> method can be used to merge an array with one or more arrays:
            </p>
            <span class="code-example">myArray.concat(['spice', 'salt']);</span>

            <!-- removing -->
            <h4>The join() Method</h4>
            <p>
                A method that can be used to turn an array into a string that includes all items in an array. The values
                are seperated by commas.
            </p>
            <span class="code-example">myArray.join();
            </span>
        </div>

        <!-- Sets -->
        <h3>Sets</h3>
        <p>
            Sets were introduced in ES6, as a data structure that represents a collection of unique values to
            avoid having duplicate values.
            <br>
            Here's an example of how you can create a set:
        </p>
        <span class="code-example">const list = new Set();</span>
