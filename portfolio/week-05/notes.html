            <h3>Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings</h3>

            <p>
                When it comes to programming, you are bound to come across errors. This is mainly caused by the possible
                reasons:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    System error ― there is a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is
                    interacting.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple
                    as a typo.
                </li>
                <li>
                    User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>


            <p>
                Writing clean code should always be the main focus of a programmer. As you write code, you should be
                fully aware of the possiblity that the code could give a potential error; this in turn could affect the
                user experience.
            </p>

            <h3>Exceptions</h3>
            <p>
                When you call a method that does not yet exist, this will result to a reference error that raises an
                exceptions. This then return an error stating, <span>"... not defined"</span>
            </p>

            <span class="pic-example">
                <img src="/portfolio/week-05/img/example-01.png" alt="Code example of using exceptions in JavaScript">
            </span>
            <h3>Stack Traces</h3>
            <p>
                A stack trace is a sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point where the error
                occurred. Stack trace works backwards from the point the error started to identify the sequence.
            </p>

            <span class="pic-example">
                <img src="/portfolio/week-05/img/example-02.png" alt="Code example of using exceptions in JavaScript">
            </span>
            <br>

            <h3>Warnings</h3>
            <p>
                A warning occurs when there's an error in the code, but it is not enough to cause the program to crash.
                Even if the program is running incorrectly and not crashing, it could cause some issues at some point.
            </p>

            <h2>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript</h2>

            <p>
                Programming that involves separating the code into objects that have properties and methods. This helps
                to keep related pieces of code encapsulated in objects "that maintain state throughout the life of the
                program."
            </p>

            <h3>Object-Oriented Programming</h3>
            <p>
                There are three main concepts in OOP: inheritance, polymorphism and encapsulation.
            </p>

            <div>
                <h4>Encapsulation</h4>
                <p>
                    The process of binding the data (variables) with the functions acting on that data. This will make
                    it possible to control the data and validate it.
                </p>

                <h4>Polymorphism</h4>
                <p>
                    The concept of reusing a single piece of code multiple times. By using polymorphism, one type of
                    object can have different behavior.
                </p>

                <h4>Inheritance</h4>
                <p>
                    The method of creating new classes on the basis of already existing classes. This allows you to
                    create new functionality whilst taking advantage of the functionality of an already existing class.
                </p>

                <h4>Classes</h4>
                <p>
                    The method of creating new classes on the basis of already existing classes. This allows you to
                    create new functionality whilst taking advantage of the functionality of an already existing class.
                </p>
            </div>
