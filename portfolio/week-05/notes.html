            <h3>Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings</h3>

            <p>
                When it comes to programming, you are bound to come across errors. This is mainly caused by the possible
                reasons:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    System error ― there is a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is
                    interacting.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple
                    as a typo.
                </li>
                <li>
                    User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>


            <p>
                Writing clean code should always be the main focus of a programmer. As you write code, you should be
                fully aware of the possiblity that the code could give a potential error; this in turn could affect the
                user experience.
            </p>

            <h3>Exceptions</h3>
            <p>
                Forms trigger a number of events, and some of these events are exclusive to forms. The
                <span>focus</span> events
                occurs when an element is focused on.
            </p>

            <span class="pic-example">
                <img src="/portfolio/week-04/img/example-02.png" alt="Code example of using forms in JavaScript">
            </span>
            <h3>Submitting a Form</h3>
            <p>
                The <span>submit</span> event when it comes to forms is one of the most important events. Normally we
                send content of the form to the server to be processed. We can use javascript however to "intercept the
                form before it’s sent by adding a <span>submit</span> event listener"
            </p>
            <span class="pic-example">
                <img src="/portfolio/week-04/img/example-03.png" alt="Code example of using forms in JavaScript">
            </span>
            <br>

            <h3>Form Controls</h3>
            <p>
                Forms have different types of controls to make the webpage more interactive. The following is the
                different types of controls in forms:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><span>input</span> fields, including text, passwords, check boxes, radio buttons, and file uploads
                </li>

                <li><span>select</span> menus for drop-down lists of options
                </li>

                <li><span>textarea</span> elements for longer text entry
                </li>

                <li><span>button</span> elements for submitting and resetting forms
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Here's a quick example of how these controls can be used in a form:
            </p>

            <span class="pic-example">
                <img src="/portfolio/week-04/img/example-04.png" alt="Code example of using forms in JavaScript">
            </span>

            <h2>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript</h2>

            <p>
                Programming that involves separating the code into objects that have properties and methods. This helps
                to keep related pieces of code encapsulated in objects "that maintain state throughout the life of the
                program."
            </p>

            <h3>Object-Oriented Programming</h3>
            <p>
                There are three main concepts in OOP: inheritance, polymorphism and encapsulation.
            </p>

            <div>
                <h4>Encapsulation</h4>
                <p>
                    The process of binding the data (variables) with the functions acting on that data. This will make
                    it possible to control the data and validate it.
                </p>

                <h4>Polymorphism</h4>
                <p>
                    The concept of reusing a single piece of code multiple times. By using polymorphism, one type of
                    object can have different behavior.
                </p>

                <h4>Inheritance</h4>
                <p>
                    The method of creating new classes on the basis of already existing classes. This allows you to
                    create new functionality whilst taking advantage of the functionality of an already existing class.
                </p>

                <h4>Classes</h4>
                <p>
                    The method of creating new classes on the basis of already existing classes. This allows you to
                    create new functionality whilst taking advantage of the functionality of an already existing class.
                </p>
            </div>
