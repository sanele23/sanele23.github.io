            <h3>Function Properties and Methods</h3>

            <p>
                Functions are first-class objects; this means that they 
                have properties and methods themselves. 
            </p>

            <h3>Call and Apply Methods</h3>
            <p>
                The <span>call()</span> method can be used to set the value of <span>this</span> inside a function 
                to an object that is provided as the first argument.
            </p>

            <span class="pic-example">
                <img src="/portfolio/week-07/img/example-01.png" alt="Code example of using exceptions in JavaScript">
            </span>

            <p>
                If the function that’s called requires any parameters, these need to be provided as arguments after the first argument, 
                which is always the value of  <span>this</span>.
            </p>

            <h3>Custom Properties</h3>
            <p>
                A stack trace is a sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point where the error
                occurred. Stack trace works backwards from the point the error started to identify the sequence.
            </p>

            <span class="pic-example">
                <img src="/portfolio/week-07/img/example-02.png" alt="Code example of using exceptions in JavaScript">
            </span>

            <h2>Ajax</h2>

            <p>
                Ajax is a technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server, 
                and it dynamically updates web pages without reloading. By doing this, data is enabled to be sent 
                and received in the background, and portions of a page is updated in response to user events whilst 
                the rest of the program continues to run. <br>
                <br>
                Ajax revolutionalized how web pages worked... web pages were no longer static but dynamic applications.
                <!-- <ul>
                    <li></li>
                </ul> -->
            </p>

            <h3>Clients and Servers</h3>
            <p>
                "A client, such as a web browser, will request a resource (usually a web page) from a server, which processes 
                the request and sends back a response to the client."
            </p>

            <h3>A Brief History of Ajax</h3>
            <p>
                Data was first sent asynchronously by Microsoft in 1999 when they implemented 
                XMLHTTP ActiveX control in Internet Explorer 5, using Javascript. However, asynchronously techniques started being 
                noticed in 2004 and 2005 when Google launched Gmail and Google Maps, as these web applications use 
                asynchronous loading techniques to improve user experience by changing the parts of the page without a full refresh.
            </p>
            <div>
                <h4>Asynchronous</h4>
                <p>
                    When a request for data is sent, the program doesn’t have to stop and wait for the response. It can carry on running, 
                    waiting for an event to fire when a response is received. By using callbacks to manage this, programs are able to run in 
                    an efficient way, avoiding lag as data is transferred back and forth.
                </p>

                <h4>JavaScript</h4>
                <p>
                    Ajax enabled JavaScript to send requests and receive responses from a server, allowing content to be updated in real time.
                </p>

                <h4>XML</h4>
                <p>
                    XML documents were often used to return data. XMl was later replaced by JSON because it is more lightweight and easier to parse than XML.
                </p>
