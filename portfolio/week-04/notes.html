            <h3>Forms</h3>

            <p>
                In html, you create a form by using the "form" element. Inside the form, you can get controls such as,
                input fields, select menus and buttons. Forms are used when you want to record data and save it to a
                server/database.
            </p>

            <span class="pic-example">
                <img src="/portfolio/week-04/img/example-01.png" alt="Code example of using forms in JavaScript">
            </span>

            <p>
                The form is named <span>search</span>, and includes two controls such as the input field and button. The
                input field is to enter the word you're searching for and the button is to submit the search input of
                the form. The action attribute is the URL the form will be submitted to so it can be processed on the
                server.
            </p>

            <h3>Accessing Form Elements</h3>
            <p>
                Forms trigger a number of events, and some of these events are exclusive to forms. The
                <span>focus</span> events
                occurs when an element is focused on.
            </p>

            <span class="pic-example">
                <img src="/portfolio/week-04/img/example-02.png" alt="Code example of using forms in JavaScript">
            </span>
            <h3>Submitting a Form</h3>
            <p>
                The <span>submit</span> event when it comes to forms is one of the most important events. Normally we
                send content of the form to the server to be processed. We can use javascript however to "intercept the
                form before itâ€™s sent by adding a <span>submit</span> event listener"
            </p>
            <span class="pic-example">
                <img src="/portfolio/week-04/img/example-03.png" alt="Code example of using forms in JavaScript">
            </span>
            <br>

            <h3>Form Controls</h3>
            <p>
                Forms have different types of controls to make the webpage more interactive. The following is the
                different types of controls in forms:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><span>input</span> fields, including text, passwords, check boxes, radio buttons, and file uploads
                </li>

                <li><span>select</span> menus for drop-down lists of options
                </li>

                <li><span>textarea</span> elements for longer text entry
                </li>

                <li><span>button</span> elements for submitting and resetting forms
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Here's a quick example of how these controls can be used in a form:
            </p>

            </span>
